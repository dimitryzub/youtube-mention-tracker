# YouTube Mention(s) Tracker

## Purpose/Idea

The main idea is taken from a great tool called [Mention](https://mention.com/en/). This demo shows the same idea but for YouTube videos only.

If you want to track someone said certain keywords like "Serp Api" or "new javascript framework"
and you want understand what's the new framework is, this is what this demo app will do. 

Another example is a keyword like "bad `company-name` service".
This is direct feedback from a customer on which the company can reflect.
